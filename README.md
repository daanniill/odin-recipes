# odin-recipes
A small project to brush up on html basics. Created a basic website that showcases the recipes of traditional Ukrainian dishes including Borscht, Kyivski Kotletki, and Varenyky.
## What I Learned
I learned how tags work and stuff again as well as how to link to different pages. I learned the basic template of websites and how different html pages should be organized.
